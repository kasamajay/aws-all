running jfrog artifactory pro as docker container on centos 7 spun on windows machine using vagrant

loads of time taken to download the artifactory image from docker.bintray.io (jfrog's public container registry)

I had to increase the vCPUs and RAM for vagrant's centos7 VM

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
    vb.gui = false
  
    vb.cpus = "4"
    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
    vb.memory = "4096"
  end
  
 Hoping it works faster now
