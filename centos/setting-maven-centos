# Maven is a Java tool, so you must have Java installed in order to proceed.

# The official CentOS repositories contain Maven packages that can be installed with the yum package manager. This is the easiest way to install Maven on CentOS. However, the version included in the repositories may lag behind the latest version of Maven.
